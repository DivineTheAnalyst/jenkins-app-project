# **Learn Jenkins App Project**

This is a React application I developed as part of my journey to explore and implement CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins. The project was bootstrapped with Create React App and showcases how to automate build and deployment processes efficiently.

## **Available Scripts**

In this project, I configured the following scripts:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.  
The application can be accessed locally at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). It supports hot reloading, so any changes I make are immediately reflected in the browser.  

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in watch mode. I used this to validate key functionalities of the app and ensure its stability during development.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production and outputs the results in the `build` folder.  
- The production build is optimized and minified for better performance.  
- Filenames are hashed for efficient caching and versioning.

### `npm run eject`
> **Note:** This command wasn’t required for this project but remains available for advanced configuration needs.

## **What I Accomplished**

This project was more than just a React application—it was an opportunity to dive deep into **Jenkins** and **CI/CD automation**. Here's what I achieved:

1. **CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins:**
   - I built a fully automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins.
   - Configured Jenkins to trigger builds on every code change pushed to the repository.
   - Automated the process of installing dependencies, running tests, and creating a production build using a Jenkinsfile.

2. **Integration with Netlify:**
   - Implemented deployment automation to Netlify directly from Jenkins.
   - Used the Netlify CLI for seamless production deployments.

3. **Dockerized Build Environment:**
   - Leveraged Docker containers in the pipeline to ensure consistent and isolated build environments.
   - Used the `node:18-alpine` image for all pipeline stages, making the build process lightweight and efficient.

4. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Automated test execution as part of the pipeline to validate the application before deployment.
   - Included steps to check the integrity of the build output, ensuring no errors in production.

## **Takeaways**

- Implementing a CI/CD pipeline greatly streamlined my development workflow, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistent deployments.
- Using Jenkins and Docker together provided a robust and scalable solution for automating the entire development lifecycle.
- The integration with Netlify made it easy to manage production deployments, minimizing downtime and errors.
